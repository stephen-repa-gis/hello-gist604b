The completetion of this exercise helped to enhance my literacy of Github.
First, I was able to gain a better understanding of what a repository is and
the type of information and files it is designed to organize, such as documents,
scripts, and licensing. The second biggest takeaway is the process of implementing
a open-source license, which was MIT in this case. The steps taken in the
exercise allowed me to see how it is done in the first place and what the 
copyright looks like when preserved on the repository product. Finally,
the verification process helped to make sense of the importance of 
ensuring the elements are alligned correctly. This will impact the validity of
the structure and the scripting being used to build the repository itself.

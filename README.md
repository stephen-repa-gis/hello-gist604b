# Hello GIST 604B

**Student:** Stephen Repa 
**Course:** GIST 604B - Open Source GIS  
**Assignment:** M1A3 - GitHub Repository Management  
**University of Arizona**

## üéØ Learning Goals
In this assignment, I'm learning:
- GitHub repository management and organization
- Professional documentation with markdown
- Open source collaboration workflows
- Version control for GIS projects

## üìã Repository Purpose
This repository demonstrates GitHub skills including:
- Creating and organizing project files
- Writing clear documentation
- Using GitHub collaborative features (Issues, labels)
- Implementing proper licensing and project configuration

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure
- `docs/` - Project documentation and learning reflections
- `scripts/` - Python scripts for GIS workflows
- `data/` - Placeholder for future spatial data

## üöÄ Usage
To run the hello script:
```bash
python scripts/hello.py




#### 3b. Create docs/learning-log.md
Create a new file in the `docs/` folder:

**How to create this file:**
1. Click "Add file" ‚Üí "Create new file"
2. In the filename box, type: `docs/learning-log.md` (this creates the `docs/` folder and the file)
3. Copy the template below into the file content area
4. Fill in all bracketed sections with your own content
5. Commit the file

**Template for docs/learning-log.md:**

```markdown

## What I Learned
In this assignment, I learned:
- [Describe 2-3 key things you learned about GitHub]
- [How Issues help teams collaborate]
- [Why documentation matters in open source projects]

## Challenges and Solutions
[Describe 1-2 challenges you faced and how you overcame them. Examples: creating folders in GitHub, understanding the two-repository workflow, writing markdown]

## Connection to My GIS Career
[Explain in 2-3 sentences how GitHub skills will help you in your GIS career. Think about portfolio building, collaboration, contributing to open source projects]

## Open Source Workflow Understanding
Creating my own repository (`hello-gist604b`) mirrors the open source contribution process. In real projects, developers fork existing repositories, make improvements, and submit contributions - similar to how I created this repository and linked it to the assignment system.

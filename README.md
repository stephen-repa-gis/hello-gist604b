# Hello GIST 604B

**Student:** Stephen Repa 
**Course:** GIST 604B - Open Source GIS  
**Assignment:** M1A3 - GitHub Repository Management  
**University of Arizona**

## üéØ Learning Goals
In this assignment, I'm learning:
- GitHub repository management and organization
- Professional documentation with markdown
- Open source collaboration workflows
- Version control for GIS projects

## üìã Repository Purpose
This repository demonstrates GitHub skills including:
- Creating and organizing project files
- Writing clear documentation
- Using GitHub collaborative features (Issues, labels)
- Implementing proper licensing and project configuration

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure
- `docs/` - Project documentation and learning reflections
- `scripts/` - Python scripts for GIS workflows
- `data/` - Placeholder for future spatial data

## üöÄ Usage
To run the hello script:
```bash
python scripts/hello.py

## What I Learned
In this assignment, I learned:

The main thing I learned is how to organize and know what is important to include in a Github repository.
Each step of the assignment allowed me to see what makes a complete page.

## Challenges and Solutions
The two-repository workflow was a little confusing with the two being located in seperate profiles. Having the two open in seperate tabs
allowed me to see them both at once and eliminate the risk of creating files and/or folders in the wrong repository.

## Connection to My GIS Career
This exercise helps me with my career by potentially showing employers that I have an understanding of how licensing and the inclusion of scripts work.
These elements tie into the importance of copyrighting, which is vital in workplace practices.  

## Open Source Workflow Understanding
Creating my own repository (`hello-gist604b`) mirrors the open source contribution process. In real projects, developers fork existing repositories, make improvements, and submit contributions - similar to how I created this repository and linked it to the assignment system.
